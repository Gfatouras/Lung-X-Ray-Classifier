## Overview

This repository contains the code and data used for classifying lung X-ray images to identify COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases. The [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) was obtained from Kaggle and includes thousands of X-ray images along with corresponding mask images. A baseline model using a sequential neural network was created first, followed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that achieved a test accuracy of 86%. A separate test notebook is also included `test.ipynb`. This notebook uses samples of X-ray images along with their masks located in `test/`, and overlays a prediction for each image, which is stored in `test_results/`. Some output examples are shown above.


## Business Problem

By analyzing these images with deep learning models, we aim to support diagnostic processes, improve the accuracy of medical image classification, and provide diagnosis support.

## Data Sources

The dataset used is the X-ray radiology [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database) available on Kaggle, which includes thousands of lung X-ray images categorized into normal, COVID-19, and viral pneumonia, along with corresponding mask images to reduce noise.

Image counts:
- Covid-19: 3,616 
- Normal: 10,192
- Viral Pneumonia: 1,345

## **Image Processing and Data Handling**

The initial steps involved ensuring that the image dimensions were 256x256 pixels. Then, the images were converted to pixel intensity arrays. Masks were applied to include only the target lung areas before feeding the data into the models.

For the dataset:
- **Normal and COVID-19 X-ray Images**: Kept at 2,000 images each. This was done intentionally to address the CNN modelâ€™s difficulty in differentiating between normal and COVID-19 images. Using more than 2,000 images did not improve the accuracy and only increased processing time.
- **Pneumonia Images**: Retained at 1,345 images. This was the maximum number of pneumonia images, and was left undersampled since the model had a harder time classifying normal and COVID-19 images compared to pneumonia.

The masks helped in focusing on the relevant lung areas, enhancing the model's ability to learn and classify the images effectively.

## Model Creation

Five models were developed:

- **Baseline Model:** A sequential neural network (NN) used as a starting point, which achieved an accuracy of 77%.

- **Model with ReduceLROnPlateau:** A Sequential NN model with the ReduceLROnPlateau callback, which improved the accuracy to 81%.

- **CNN Model:** A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that also achieved an accuracy of 81%.

- **CNN + Data Augmentation:** A CNN model combined with data augmentation techniques, which improved the accuracy to 86%.

- **CNN + L2 Regularization:** A CNN model with L2 regularization, which achieved an accuracy of 83%.


## Evaluation

## **Conclusion**

### **CNN Model Performance**

The CNN model performed the best, achieving a test accuracy of 86%. The model's similar F1 scores and smooth convergence of loss values indicate that there is no overfitting present. Among the different classifications, viral pneumonia was the easiest to identify, with the best classification rate of 97%.

This model can be utilized by healthcare professionals to assist in:

- **Decision support**
- **Early detection**
- **Disease progression monitoring**
- **Reducing human error**
- **Providing rapid diagnosis through X-ray images alone**

## **Future Improvements**

### **Enhancing the Model**

While the CNN model performed well, there are still ways to improve it:

- **Additional Training Data**: More normal and COVID-19 images should be included in training.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Utilizing pre-trained models could increase the accuracy rate to around 91%.
- **Broader Disease Detection**: Include different lung diseases to allow the model to detect additional illnesses, as current diseases like bronchitis might slip detection.
